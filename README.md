# shopping-cart
Classic shopping cart app made with TypeScript and React following the Odin Project Curriculum. The idea of this project is to integrate the Toolkit given by
TOP to create apps using React Framework. 

This project counts with the following tools and strategies (although most of them are provided by the TOP Curriculum some has been selected by me):

# Typescript as primary language: 
-The project uses TS in order to explore the features of it and achieve a cleaner, concise project using best practices that this language provide.

# Vite as bundling tool: 
-TOP recommends using Create React App, but since the React removed it from the official docs, it seems to be a proper approach to use a better supported bundling tool for this project.
-Vite has proven to be lot faster at craeating and running projects in React.

# Jest/React testing library as unitary testing tool: 
-As TOP recommends, I use Jest and RTL as testing tool. It offers simple and concise testing case methods to test fetching and routing components (As primordial targets of testing of this app).

# React-Router/React-RouterDOM: 
-The React Router Package is used as Router in order to provide a better UI/UX.
